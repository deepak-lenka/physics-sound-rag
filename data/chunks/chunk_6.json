These make the sound wave that\nFig. 11.4: A vibrating object creating a series of\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\nthe medium.\nSCIENCE\nRationalised 2023-24\npropagates through the medium.\nCompression is the region of high pressure\nand rarefaction is the region of low pressure.\nPressure is related to the number of particles\nof a medium in a given volume. More density\nof the particles in the medium gives more\npressure and vice versa. Thus, propagation\nof sound can be visualised as propagation of\ndensity variations or pressure variations in\nthe medium.\nQ\nuestion\n1. How does the sound produced by\na vibrating object in a medium\nreach your ear?\n2. Explain how sound is produced\nby your school bell.\n3. Why are sound waves called\nmechanical waves?\n4.
