Both\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\nof the source. But the sounds we receive are\ndifferent. This is due to the different\ncharacteristics associated with the sound.\nPitch is one of the characteristics.\nHow the brain interprets the frequency\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\nsounds of different pitch.\nThe magnitude of the maximum\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\nFig. 11.7: Low pitch sound has l"}
