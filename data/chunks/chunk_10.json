{"text": "ance between two consecutive\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\nusually represented by \u03bb (Greek letter\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\nHeinrich Rudolph Hertz\nwas born on 22 February\n1857 in Hamburg,\nGermany and educated at\nthe University of Berlin. He\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell\u2019s\nelectromagnetic theory by\nhis experiments. He laid the\nH. R. Hertz\nfoundation for future\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\nand even television. He also discovered the\nphotoelectric effect which was later\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour.\nFrequency tells us how frequently an\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\nyour beating the drum. We know that when\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b"}
