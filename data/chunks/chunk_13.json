The\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\nthe force with which an object is made to\nvibrate.

If we hit the table\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\nsource. As it moves away from the source its\namplitude as well as its loudness decreases.\nLouder sound can travel a larger distance as\nit is associated with higher energy.
