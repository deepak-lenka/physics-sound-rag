Sometimes a\ncurved soundboard may be placed\nbehind the stage so that the sound,\nafter reflecting from the sound board,\nspreads evenly across the width of the\nhall (Fig 11.13).\n3.

Why are the ceilings of concert\nhalls curved?\nFig. 11.12: Curved ceiling of a conference hall.\n11.4 Range of Hearing\nThe audible range of sound for human beings\nextends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one\nHz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\na"}
