{"text": "t they are not the same. Loudness is a\nmeasure of the response of the ear to the sound.\nEven when two sounds are of equal intensity,\nwe may hear one as louder than the other\nsimply because our ear detects it better.\n132\nSCIENCE\nRationalised 2023-24\nQ\nuestion\n1. Distinguish between loudness\nand intensity of sound.\n11.2.3 SPEED OF SOUND IN DIFFERENT\nMEDIA\nSound propagates through a medium at a finite\nspeed. The sound of a thunder is heard a little\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\nm s\u20131 at 0 \u00baC "}
