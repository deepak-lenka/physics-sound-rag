The sound\nwhich is produced due to a mixture of several\nfrequencies is called a note and is pleasant to\nlisten to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music\nis pleasant to hear and is of rich quality.\n1. Which wave property determines\n(a) loudness, (b) pitch?\n2. Guess which sound has a higher\nQ Questions\npitch: guitar or car horn?\nThe speed of sound is defined as the\ndistance which a point on a wave, such as a\ncompression or a rarefaction, travels per unit\ntime.\nWe know,\nspeed, v = distance / time\n\u03bb\nExample 11.1 A sound wave has a\nfrequency of 2 kHz and wave length\n35 cm. How long will it take to travel\n1.5 km?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nFrequency, \u03bd = 2 kHz = 2000 Hz\nWavelength, \u03bb = 35 cm = 0.35 m\nWe know that speed, v of the wave\n= wavelength \u00d7 frequency\nv = \u03bb \u03bd\n= 0.35 m 2000 Hz = 700 m/s\nThe time taken by the wave to travel a\ndistance, d of 1.5 km is\nT"}
