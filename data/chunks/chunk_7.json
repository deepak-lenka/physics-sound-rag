If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n\u2022 If you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.\nThe regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply os"}
