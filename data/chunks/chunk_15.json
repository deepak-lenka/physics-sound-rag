{"text": "hus sound will take 2.1 s to travel a\ndistance of 1.5 km.\n=\nT\nHere \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave. It\nis the distance travelled by the sound wave in\none time period (T) of the wave. Thus,\nv = \u03bb \u03bd\nor v = \u03bb \u03bd\nThat is, speed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency.\nThe speed of sound remains almost the\nsame for all frequencies in a given medium\nunder the same physical conditions.\nuestions\n1. What are wavelength, frequency,\ntime period and amplitude of a\nsound wave?\n2. How are the wavelength and\nfrequency of a sound wave\nrelated to its speed?\n3. Calculate the wavelength of a\nsound wave whose frequency is\n220 Hz and speed is 440 m/s in\na given medium.\n4. A person is listening to a tone of\n500 Hz sitting at a distance of\n450 m from the source of the\nsound. What is the time interval\nbetween successive compressions\nfrom the source?\nThe amount of sound energy passing each\nsecond through unit area is called the intensity\nof sound. We sometimes use the terms\n\u201cloudness\u201d and \u201cintensity\u201d interchangeably,\nbu"}
