{"text": " a disturbance that moves\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\nmove forward themselves, but the\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\ncalled mechanical waves.\nAir is the most common medium through\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\nair in front of it creating a region of high\npressure. This region is called a compression\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\nit creates a region of low pressure called\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\nof compressions and rarefactions is creat"}
