{"text": "thoroughly cleaned.\n\u2022 Ultrasounds can be used to detect\ncracks and flaws in metal blocks.\n136\nin construction of big structures like\nbuildings, bridges, machines and also\nscientific equipment. The cracks or\nholes inside the metal blocks, which\nare invisible from outside reduces the\nstrength of the structure. Ultrasonic\nwaves are allowed to pass through the\nmetal block and detectors are used to\ndetect the transmitted waves. If there\nis even a small defect, the ultrasound\ngets reflected back indicating the\npresence of the flaw or defect, as shown\nin Fig. 11.14.\nFig 11.14: Ultrasound is reflected back from the\ndefective locations inside a metal block.\nOrdinary sound of longer wavelengths\ncannot be used for such purpose as it will\nbend around the corners of the defective\nlocation and enter the detector.\n\u2022 Ultrasonic waves are made to reflect\nfrom various parts of the heart and\nform the image of the heart.
