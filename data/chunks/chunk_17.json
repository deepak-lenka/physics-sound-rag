In which of the three media, air,\nwater or iron, does sound travel\nthe fastest at a particular\ntemperature?\n11.3 Reflection of Sound\nSound bounces off a solid or a liquid like a\nrubber ball bounces off a wall. Like light, sound\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\nActivity ____"}
