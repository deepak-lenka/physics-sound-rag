This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density\u2014 it is not a mechanical\nwave. You will come to know more about\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\nWAVE\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 11.5: Longitudinal wave in a slinky.\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\n\u2022 fre"}
