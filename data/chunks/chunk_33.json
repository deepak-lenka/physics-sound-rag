{"text": "reflected from a distant object, an echo is\nproduced. Let the distance between the reflecting surface\nand the source of sound production remains the same. Do\nyou hear echo sound on a hotter day?\n11. 12. Give two practical applications of reflection of sound waves.\nA stone is dropped from the top of a tower 500 m high into a\npond of water at the base of the tower. When is the splash\nheard at the top? Given, g = 10 m s\u20132 and speed of sound =\n340 m s\u20131\n.\nSCIENCE\nRationalised 2023-24\n13. 14. 15. 16. 17. A sound wave travels at a speed of 339 m s\u20131. If its wavelength\nis 1.5 cm, what is the frequency of the wave? Will it be\naudible?\nWhat is reverberation? How can it be reduced?\nWhat is loudness of sound? What factors does it depend on?\nHow is ultrasound used for cleaning?\nExplain how defects in a metal block can be detected using\nultrasound.\nSOUND 139"}
