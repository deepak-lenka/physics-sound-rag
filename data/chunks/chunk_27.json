What is the audible range of the\naverage human ear?\nWhat is the range of frequencies\nassociated with\n(a) Infrasound?\n(b) Ultrasound?\n11.5 Applications of Ultrasound\nUltrasounds are high frequency waves.\nUltrasounds are able to travel along well-\ndefined paths even in the presence of\nobstacles. Ultrasounds are used extensively\nin industries and for medical purposes.\n\u2022 Ultrasound is generally used to clean\nparts located in hard-to-reach places,\nfor example, spiral tube, odd shaped\nparts, electronic components, etc.\nObjects to be cleaned are placed in a\ncleaning solution and ultrasonic waves\nare sent into the solution. Due to\nthe high frequency, the particles of\ndust, grease and dirt get detached and\ndrop out. The objects thus get\nthoroughly cleaned.\n\u2022 Ultrasounds can be used to detect\ncracks and flaws in metal blocks.\n136\nin construction of big "}
