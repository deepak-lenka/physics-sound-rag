{"text": "ain a little later. This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperature, say at 22 \u00baC in air, the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) \u00d7 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\nis due to the successive reflections of the\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\nsuch as the clouds and th"}
