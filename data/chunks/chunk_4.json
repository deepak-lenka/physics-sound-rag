{"text": "he\ninstrument vibrates to produce\nsound.\n11.2 Propagation of Sound\nSound is produced by vibrating objects. The\nmatter or substance through which sound\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\nmedium from the point of generation to the\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\n128\nthe vibrating object to the ear. A particle of\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\nfirst particle comes back to its original\nposition. This process continues in the\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\ndisturbance created by a source of sound in\nthe medium travels through the medium and\nnot the particles of the medium.\nA wave is"}
