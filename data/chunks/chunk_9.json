The density as well as the\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\nwith distance, above and below the average\nvalue of density and pressure. Fig. 11.6(a) and\nSOUND 129\nRationalised 2023-24\nFig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\nwave propagates in the medium.\nCompressions are the regions where\nparticles are crowded together and\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\nof maximum compression. Thus,\ncompressions are regions where density as\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\nregions of low pressure where particles are\nspread apart and are represented by the\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\nThe dist"}
