{"text": "), (c) represents\ngraphically the density and pressure variations.\n130\nSCIENCE\nRationalised 2023-24\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\nchange in density from the maximum value\nto the minimum value, then again to the\nmaximum value, makes one complete\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\nwave. If we can count the number of the\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\n\u03bd (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz\n(symbol, Hz).\nThe time taken by two consecutive\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\nother words, we can say that the time taken\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\nFrequency and time period are related as\nfollows:\nv\n=\nT\nA violin and a flute "}
