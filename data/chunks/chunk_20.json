{"text": "e land.\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\naudible. The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\n134\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s\u20131?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s\u20131\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v \u00d7 t = 346 m s\u20131 \u00d7 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cl"}
